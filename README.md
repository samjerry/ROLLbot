# ROLLbot

This project is a project for Inholland University of Applied Sciences made by Jerry Sam, Nino Torrisi and Joost Meereboer

# What is it?
ROLLbot is a robot which people are able to use during their tabletop RPG games. It takes the effort off grabbing all the right dice and the correct amount, and puts it onto an easy to use User Interface.

# How are we going to achieve it?
